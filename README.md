       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - PUID=1000
         - PGID=1000
         - TZ=Etc/UTC
         - DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/seasonarr.db
         - JWT_SECRET_KEY=change-this-to-a-secure-random-string
       volumes:
         - seasonarr_data:/app/data
         - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
       networks:
         - sonarrNetwork

   volumes:
     seasonarr_data:

   networks:

docker volume create seasonarr_data

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name seasonarr \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v seasonarr_data:/app/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here \
  -e DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/seasonarr.db \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/d3v1l1989/seasonarr:latest
```


### First-Time Setup
